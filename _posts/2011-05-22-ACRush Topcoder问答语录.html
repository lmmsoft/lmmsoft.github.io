<div> <p>FameofLight &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: Finally the god of programming arrives&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>FameofLight &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: do you follow a random practice , or you practice question by topic , in your early days&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;FameofLight: No, our team practiced 3 or 4 full contests a week.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>pt1989 &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: Can u tell us whom or what do u credit for ur success?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;pt1989: I think more practice is the way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>ktuan &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: how can you arrange your study with 3-4 contests a week ?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;ktuan: UVA, SGU , ZJU and PKU is enough.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>pt1989 &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: what is ur method of practising? random or organised?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;pt1989: contest env. &nbsp;We always solve programs in contest env.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sunny_05 &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: wat is ur daily routine ?? i mean hw do u practice everyday ??&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;Sunny_05: We only have weekly routine for practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>binarywithme &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: what u think about world final problems..level of difficulty&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;binarywithme: A little harder than 1000p.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>MB__ &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: Which of these do you do after you submit your solution on TC: test solution, re-read problem statement, check code line by line&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;MB__: test for at least 10 cases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>martins256 &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: how many problems have you solved on OJ ?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;martins256: about 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>kcm1700 &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: How many problems have you proposed on OJ or anything like this competition or something...?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;kcm1700: about 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>vijay_comc &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: Who is your Arch Rival in Programming ? ;)&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;vijay_comc: Petr, I think.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SomethingWrong &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: What is your favourite Online Judge? :)&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;SomethingWrong: SGU.&nbsp;</p><p>vexorian &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: Why SGU?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;vexorian: More tricky testcases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dee2306 &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: Being one of top programmers, do u believe its just practice which makes u perfect.. or some of u are born genius ?? :)&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;Dee2306: It's at least 80% due to practice&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>stormsky &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: how to practice ACM for a ACM beginner?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;stormsky: practice in contest env.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>piva &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: Do you train more of one category of problems?

U select some random problems from OJs and solve or try to master a particular domain like DP by solving problems based on that or any other thing?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;rajeshsr: set problems of past regionals and finals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>puneetkp444 &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: Can you suggest some ways to improve problem solving abilities&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;puneetkp444: practice all kinds of problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>alft7 &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: what do you usually do before a very important competition, practise or something else?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;alft7: practice until 3 days before it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>ferry &nbsp; &nbsp;ACRush: What is the hardest problem you've done?&nbsp;</p><p>ACRush &nbsp; &nbsp;ferry: I in WF2007.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p> </div>
