<p>This is the second day of this winter holiday.</p>
<p>I know I must do a lot in this winter holiday ,so I go back to school ,in the training room, I would have a better efficency!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>details:</p>
<p>1)</p>
<p>00:00 regist the codeforce #52 , but it is a long time since last coding, so I am in very bad condition.Firstly,i didn't read the problem correctly, wa 3 times, I got the ac 30 minutes after the match started.I passed the pretest of problem B at 50mins, but it failed the final test after the contest.It was because when debuging,I found a small mistake and corrected it,but this sentence appeared two times,I didn't correct the other one,so....</p>
<p>Then ,I spent the last 1 hour in problem E,but there is something wrong with my IDE(both netbeans and Eev),I can't debug the long codes,then the contest ended...</p>
<p>1.尽快恢复状态 2.提升代码习惯 3.重整系统</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)I went back to school in the afternoon,then I found some problems on poj ,1579 is a simple problem,you could finish by both recursion and dp,but 注意题目的优先计算顺序。先是考虑是否会小于0，然后才考虑是否会大于20，要不然就会WA。（害得我wa了一下午,555）</p>
